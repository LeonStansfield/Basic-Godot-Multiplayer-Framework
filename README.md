## Basic Godot 4 Multiplayer Framework

This is a simple and reusable peer-hosted LAN based multiplayer framework for Godot 4 projects.
I made this as a starting point for creating basic multiplayer games in Godot.
Feel free to play around or fork to expand on in your own projects.

### Todo:

 - Implement ball pickup/throw
 - Implement Frisbee
 - Implement text chat
